Project Description:

Our project will be centered on two categories: 
          
  **The first is a donation charity to which people can donate items.

  **The second category will consist of a shop products page where we will sell items crafted by people of determination. To donate items or purchase    products from us, the user must first login and enter his or her information. The website will be able to process requests from donors and will have an existing product list. The entire profit earned from the product sales will directly go to the charity home.
